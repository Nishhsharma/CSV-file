Overview

This project demonstrates basic file handling in Java.
It performs the following tasks:

Creates a sample CSV file (products.csv) containing product names and prices.

Reads the CSV file line by line using BufferedReader.

Splits each line by a comma (,) to extract product name and price.

Parses the price (string â†’ double).

Filters products with price greater than 1000.

Writes the filtered products into a new CSV file (products_over_1000.csv) using FileWriter.

Prints a success message and verifies the new file contents.
